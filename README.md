# API-Project-Fall-21
Anime suggestion website project, made with 3 APIs .


There are so many different things to watch through digital streaming today, it can be difficult to decide what you would like to watch. It can be even more difficult to decide if you are trying to watch foreign entertainment. One sort of foreign entertainment that has become very popular in the United States is Japanese “Anime”, or animation. In this API project, I will create a website to suggest anime to users.

Weather can affect a person greatly, it can set their mood for the day, and when it comes to entertainment, weather can add to the impact and immersion of a show or movie. The proposed program will suggest anime to users based on their weather data. It will use the "ipgeolocation" API to get the user's location based on their IP address. It will use the “QWeather” API to find weather data for the user’s location. The weather data will be used to generate recommendations of anime to the user, obtained from the API “AniList”. Depending on the weather, different genres of anime will be recommended. For instance, if it is raining, the program will recommend to the user, animes in the genre of horror. If the user is experiencing more clear and sunny weather, the program will suggest action and adventure animes. With a program like this, users will have a fun and easy way to find new animes to watch.
